# CS Review 

## About
As I approach the completion of my CS undergraduate degree, I thought it would be a good idea to review some CS fundamentals. Here I will have material covering the basics of CS including search and sorting algorithms, data structures, time complexity, etc. Much of this material are topics that I learned earlier in my degree where a refresher is needed/would like to practice more. I will also put some implementations of interview questions I find online. Feel free to contact me if you would like to contribute. <br>

For C++ programs, I am using MinGW's GCC compiler. <br>
