// Bubblesort goes through the entire array, checks the current element and the next one, then swaps them if they
// are not in correct order. By this method, we will eventually put all elements in correct place. 
// We mus perform an entire pass without needing to swap before we can be sure the array is sorted. As such, this method
// is inefficient as we must make another pass after the array is sorted. 

// Pre: arr is an array of unique integers, n is the size of the array
// Post: return arr sorted in ascending order
