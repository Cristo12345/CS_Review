// Write a method that replaces all spaces in a string with '%20'. Assume the
// string has neough space to hold the additional chars and you are
// given the "true length" of the string

// IN: "Mr John Smith    "
// OUT: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

// NOTE: A common approach for manipulation strings is to start editing
// from the end and working backwards. Helpful if we have extra buffer
// space in the end.
